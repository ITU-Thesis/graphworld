    "### Notebook for aggregating a collection of HPC tasks on GraphWorld\n",
    "Given a type of experiment, this notebook takes all the json result files of a collection of HPC tasks and moves them into a single file in the `processed` directory. It also maintains a summary file in the same folder for all files for the experiment. Finally it loads the result files and prints basic statistics not part of the summary file (see last cell of this file).\n",
    "\n",
    "Set `RAW_DIR` to the raw experiments you want to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set `PROCESSED_DIR` to where the processed results should be stored.\n",
    "The processed results will be stored in shards. Each time this notebook is ran, 1 shard is created. E.g. the shard size depends on the contents of the `RAW_DIR`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing assumes that the raw results come from our HPC experimental setup."
